## Project Overview 
This is my group's presentation based on the Fastenal Data Case (included above) for the Tippie Internal Case Competition on 2/26/2023. This analytics case competition was hosted to determine what four students will go on the compete at the Business Analytics Case Competition. The national competition will take place on April 7th, 2023 and is Sponsored by the Heineken Company. 

The internal case competition was based on Fastenal Company. The goal of this project was to define a business problem, conduct analysis answering the relevant questions, create marketing recommendations and to present the case to facutly judges. 

## Analysis Conclusions & Recommendations
My group recommended that Fastenal should have a defined a core customer segment that consisted of the top 25% of customers based on sales from their top 3 sectors. Some additioanl supporting recommendations are below:
- Fastenal should focus direct marketing towards new customers withing their core industries.
- Fastenal should incorporate dynamic customer segmenting every year in order to understand their customer base.
- Fastenal should invest more marketing resources in their government, transportation and wholesale trade segments. These groups had relatively low numbers for the amount of customers within each group, yet high sales and number of invoices.
